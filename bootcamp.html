        <h1 class="h1">My Fight Poster<br></h1>
        <p class="p-main">Thinking about my fight for the semester has been heavily influenced by my late explorations in permaculture and terrible consequences of industrial agriculture. <br></p>
        <div class="img-div"><img src="images/poster__iaac_01.jpg" loading="lazy" srcset="images/poster__iaac_01-p-500.jpeg 500w, images/poster__iaac_01-p-800.jpeg 800w, images/poster__iaac_01-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, images/poster__iaac_01-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, images/poster__iaac_01-p-2000.jpeg 2000w, images/poster__iaac_01.jpg 2380w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 92vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, (max-width: 991px) 75vw, (max-width: 1279px) 80vw, (max-width: 1439px) 58vw, (max-width: 1919px) 50vw, 940px" alt="" class="img-main"></div>
        <p class="p-main">The theme of &quot;Screw Sustainability&quot; led to some erroneous impressions in class. It&#x27;s also been the first work we ever presented to each other, and in my own fashion, I always think it&#x27;s better to make a bold first impression from the beginning onwards. <br></p>
        <p class="p-main">The story I always like to accompany together with the poster goes as follows: <br><br>Imagine you&#x27;ve been in a relationship for a long period of time, let&#x27;s say 10 years. In the beginning of the relationship, you went on a couple of dates, you slowly started to follow in love with the other person. It&#x27;s the best time you&#x27;re having in your life... As you start a relationship, you are slowly getting into a routine, but your partner, all of a sudden, is becoming a total toxic bully, taking advantage of your emotions, body and everything else that&#x27;s part of you. Such a horrific relationship is going on for <em>years</em> now, after the partner realises that they&#x27;ve been terrible to you and starts apologising and saying they won&#x27;t do these terrible things to you know. <br><br>Would you <strong>want to sustain</strong> such a relationship? I think now. At the very least, after years of degenerating the relationship, one can&#x27;t just go back to normal, one needs to <strong>rebuild, improve and regenerate what&#x27;s been lost</strong>. <br><br>That&#x27;s a metaphor I&#x27;ve chosen to present the first week of MDEF to my classmates, signalling that the <strong>relationship between humans and the planet can&#x27;t be of a sustainable nature but that of regeneration</strong>. <br></p>
